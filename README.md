# Fine-Tuned LLM - Llama 3.2 1B Model 🚀

Welcome to the Fine-Tuned LLM project using the Llama 3.2 1B model! This project utilizes personal data for fine-tuning and has been successfully uploaded to Hugging Face for inference.

## 🧠 Overview

In this project, the Llama 3.2 1B language model has been fine-tuned on a specific dataset (personal data) to improve its performance for our specific use cases. The fine-tuning process enhances the model's ability to understand and generate contextually accurate responses.

## ⚙️ Features

- **Fine-Tuned Model**: Llama 3.2 1B model fine-tuned on personal data.
- **Inference**: Uploaded to Hugging Face for easy access and inference.
- **Personalized Responses**: Model is tailored for personalized tasks and queries.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fine-tuned-llm.git
cd fine-tuned-llm
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Load and Use the Model for Inference

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

# Load the fine-tuned model from Hugging Face
model_name = "your-huggingface-username/llama-3-2-1b-finetuned"
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Sample inference
input_text = "How do you use this model?"
inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model.generate(inputs["input_ids"])

# Print the generated output
print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```
